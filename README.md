# Customer_Acquisition_ML_Model
The motivation behind predicting Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is to enable Food Mart to optimize its marketing budget and resources effectively. By understanding the cost associated with acquiring a customer through media campaigns, Food Mart can make informed decisions on resource allocation, campaign strategies, and audience targeting. This predictive model aims to provide actionable insights, helping Food Mart enhance its return on investment (ROI) by identifying cost-effective customer acquisition channels and tailoring campaigns to specific customer segments and store profiles. Efficiently managing CAC is crucial for sustaining and growing Food Mart's customer base in a competitive market, ensuring that marketing efforts yield maximum value and contribute to the overall success of the business.
